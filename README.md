## üìö Overview

The goal of this module is to provide a solid foundation in Python for data science.  
By completing these exercises, you will learn to manipulate data, visualize results, and apply programming concepts to real tasks.

These exercises not only help you learn Python syntax, but also encourage writing clean, structured code, following rules like:  
- Using **flake8** for style compliance  
- Avoiding code in the global scope  
- Defining a **main** function in each program  
- Adding **docstrings** for every function and class

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Python Basics

This chapter introduces core Python syntax and structures:  

- **Syntax and Control Flow:** if/else, loops, exceptions, boolean logic  
- **Data Structures:** lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets  
- **Functions:** defining, calling, and scope  
- **Iterators and Generators:** memory-efficient looping  
- **Package Management:** installing and importing modules  

**Skills:**  
- Writing clean Python scripts  
- Using Python built-in types effectively  
- Structuring code with functions

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing and Visualization

Learn to work with real-world data and visualize it effectively:  

- **Data Handling:** reading/writing CSV, cleaning and filtering data using **Pandas**  
- **Visualization:** plotting with **Matplotlib**  
- Creating scatter plots and line charts  
- Exploring dataset distributions and correlations  

**Skills:**  
- Loading and cleaning datasets  
- Performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Presenting data visually for better insights

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Functional and Object-Oriented Programming

This chapter introduces paradigms for modular and reusable code:  

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, understanding complex situations like diamond inheritance  
- **Modular Design:** organizing code into modules and packages  

**Skills:**  
- Writing reusable and maintainable Python code  
- Understanding OOP principles in Python  
- Structuring larger projects

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Python Features

Explore Python‚Äôs more advanced capabilities:  

- **Argument Handling:** `*args` and `**kwargs`  
- **Decorators:** modifying function behavior dynamically  
- **Closures:** capturing variables in nested functions  
- **Dataclasses:** memory-efficient structures  

**Skills:**  
- Writing more expressive and Pythonic code  
- Applying high-level programming patterns  
- Leveraging Python‚Äôs advanced features in projects

## üîó Requirements

These exercises are mainly built with Python 3.10, with some dependencies required.

Each project includes a `venv.sh` and `requirements.txt` to help set up a virtual environment and install necessary packages:

```bash
bash venv.sh
source venv/bin/activate
